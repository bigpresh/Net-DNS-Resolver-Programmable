    very useful distribution.  Plan to fix various RT tickets.
  * Fix RT 109266 - avoid deprecated make_query_packet() call


--- 0.003 (2007-05-30 22:00)

  Miscellaneous:
  ! Build-require Module::Build >= 0.2805, hopefully fixing a version.pm/
    CPAN.pm compatibility issue (see rt.cpan.org #26784).
    (Debian packaging is not affected because it does not rely on META.yml.)
  * Added LICENSE file explicitly including the verbatim license texts.

  Debian:
  * Depends: libnet-dns-perl
  * Dropped build dependency on libtest-simple-perl for now.  There are
    currently no tests.

--- 0.002.2 (2007-01-09 13:00)

  * Explicitly mention license in README file.

--- 0.002.1 (2006-11-15 15:30)

  ! Requires version package.
  * Correctly handle undefined result code returned by custom resolver code.

--- 0.002 (2006-11-15 03:45)

  + Support non-RCODE strings to be returned by custom resolver code, which is
    then taken as the resolver's error string.
  * Do not fold identical returned RRs into a single RR.
  * Minor documentation fixes.

--- 0.001 (initial release) (2006-10-23 00:00)
